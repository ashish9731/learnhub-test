# Fix Company Creation RLS Policies

This migration fixes the RLS policies to allow proper company creation
by the super admin and ensures all policies work correctly.

## Changes Made:
1. Drop all existing problematic policies
2. Create simplified, working policies for company operations
3. Ensure super admin can perform all operations
4. Allow authenticated users to create companies (with proper validation)
