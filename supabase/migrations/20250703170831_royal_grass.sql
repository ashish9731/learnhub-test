# Fix Companies RLS Policy - Final Solution

1. Database Changes
   - Drop all existing problematic policies on companies table
   - Create simplified, working RLS policies
   - Fix super admin access using proper auth functions
   - Allow authenticated users to create and read companies

2. Security
   - Super admin has full access to all companies
   - Authenticated users can create and read companies
   - Admins can update their own company

3. Performance
   - Simplified policy checks to avoid recursion
   - Proper indexing for policy performance
