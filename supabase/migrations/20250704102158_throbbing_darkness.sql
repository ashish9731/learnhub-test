  # Fix RLS Policy Infinite Recursion

  1. Problem
    - The `users` table has RLS policies that create infinite recursion
    - Policies are trying to query the `users` table from within the `users` table policies
    - This creates circular dependencies causing "infinite recursion detected" errors

  2. Solution
    - Remove the problematic recursive policies
    - Create simpler, non-recursive policies that don't reference the users table from within itself
    - Use auth.uid() directly instead of querying the users table for role checks
    - Implement role-based access through auth metadata or separate role checks

  3. Changes
    - Drop existing problematic policies on users table
    - Create new non-recursive policies
    - Ensure other tables' policies don't create recursion with users table
